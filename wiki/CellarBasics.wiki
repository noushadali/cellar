= Mute or deaf a node to cluster events =

Each node of the cluster can be marked as mute or deaf, in order to stop listening or broadcasting events to the cluster. This is done by turning on/off the event consumer or event producer.

*Consumer*

You may wish to "lock" a node so that its not affected by cluster events. The easiest way to do so is by switching its consumer to off.

{{{
cluster:consumer-stop 192.168.1.101:5702
}}}
or
{{{
cluster:consumer-start 192.168.1.101:5702
}}}

*Producer*

You may wish to have a node not broadcast cluster events. This can be very usefull when performing maintenance tasks on a node.

{{{
cluster:producer-stop 192.168.1.101:5702
}}}
or
{{{
cluster:producer-start 192.168.1.101:5702
}}}


Sample output:
||Node                 ||Status||
||192.168.1.101:5702   ||false||
